## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Overall Impact
Of the total documented migrants:
- **85,000 survivors**
- **34,000 deaths**
- **24,000 missing persons**

These figures underscore the profound human toll associated with irregular migration and unsafe transit routes.

### 2. Demographic Distribution
**Type of Migrants:**
- **Males**: 61.57% - representing the majority of recorded cases
- **Females**: 25.29%
- **Children**: 13.14% - a significant vulnerable population facing life-threatening risks

**Key Insight:** While irregular migration predominantly affects men, a notable number of children are exposed to dangers that threaten their lives.

### 3. Countries of Origin
**Top Origins:**
- **Unknown**: 55%+ of migrants (7.2K incidents) - reflecting major gaps in data collection and documentation
- **Afghanistan**: 1.7K incidents - the second-highest, driven by decades of armed conflict, political instability, and international restrictions
- **Mexico**: 0.7K incidents
- **Syrian Arab Republic**: 0.3K incidents
- **Honduras**: 0.3K incidents

**Key Insight:** The high percentage of unknown origins highlights critical challenges in migrant identification and record-keeping during incidents.

### 4. Causes of Incidents
**Leading Causes of Death:**
1. **Drowning**: 3.3K incidents - the primary cause
2. **Mixed or Unknown**: 3.2K incidents
3. **Vehicle Accidents/Death in Transit**: 2.1K incidents
4. **Harsh Environmental Conditions**: 1.4K incidents
5. **Violence**: 1.3K incidents

**Key Insight:** Most incidents result from unsafe transportation methods and extremely hazardous travel conditions, particularly maritime routes.

### 5. Temporal Trends
The "Total Incident Type by Year" chart shows:
- Steady increase from 2014 (0.1K) to 2020 (1.8K)
- **Peak in 2022**: 2.2K incidents - the highest during the study period
- Slight decline in 2023 (0.8K)

**Key Insight:** The 2022 spike likely reflects overlapping global crises, increased displacement due to conflicts, post-COVID-19 border policy changes, and heightened migration pressures.

### 6. Geographic Distribution
The heat map visualization shows incident concentrations across:
- Mediterranean routes (Europe-Africa)
- Central American migration corridors
- Middle Eastern pathways
- Various maritime crossings

## 💡 Dashboard Features
- **Interactive filters** by year (2014-2023)
- **Geographic heat map** showing incident locations
- **Demographic breakdowns** by gender and age
- **Cause analysis** with detailed incident categorization
- **Temporal trends** visualization
- **Country of origin** analysis

## 🎯 Key Conclusions

This analysis reveals that irregular migration remains a **global humanitarian crisis** characterized by:

1. **High mortality and missing person rates** - nearly 40% of migrants documented either died or went missing
2. **Significant data gaps** - over half of migrants cannot be identified by country of origin
3. **Vulnerable populations at risk** - including a substantial number of children
4. **Persistent dangers** associated with unsafe routes, inadequate transportation, and geopolitical instability
5. **Escalating trends** - particularly visible in the 2022 spike

## 📌 Final Message

**Behind every statistic is a human story.** 

This dashboard emphasizes the urgent need for:
- Safer migration pathways
- Improved documentation and identification systems
- Enhanced international protection for migrants
- Humanitarian responses that prioritize lives over borders
- Data-driven policy interventions to prevent future tragedies
